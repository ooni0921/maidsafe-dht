Windows Build Instructions
==========================


Building With MinGW
===================
#  Open a Windows command terminal and cd to build dir for Windows (src\build\Win)
#  Run cmake ..\.. -G"CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles".  This will create a CodeBlocks
   project src\build\Win\maidsafe-dht.cbp which will allow you to make and install
   all the targets from within the CodeBlocks IDE.

If MinGW was added to your path, you should also be able to build the targets from a Windows command terminal:

    *  Run mingw32-make to make all targets.
    *  Run mingw32-make Experimental to configure, build, test and upload to our dashboard.
    *  Run mingw32-make package to create an installer.
    *  Run mingw32-make install to install the maidsafe-dht library to c:\usr\lib and API headers to c:\usr\include.


Building With Visual Studio
===========================
#  Open a Windows command terminal and cd to build dir for Windows (src\build\Win)
#  Run one of the following commands appropriate to your MSVC version:

    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 6"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 7"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 8 2005"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 9 2008"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 10"
    *  cmake ..\.. -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64"

   This will create an MSVC solution src\build\Win\maidsafe_dht.sln which
   will allow you to make all the targets from within the chosen MSVC IDE.
   
   Once the solution is built, you can run extract_includes.bat to create a
   directory "include" which will contain the public headers.
