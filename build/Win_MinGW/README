Windows Build Instructions - Building With MinGW
================================================

These instructions relate to using a MinGW environment to build the project.  If you
want to use Microsoft Visual Studio instead, move to build/Win_MSVC and see the README there.

#  Open a Windows command terminal
#  cd to build dir for Windows matching the build type required (build\Win_MinGW\Debug, build\Win_MinGW\Release, etc.)
#  Run cmake ..\.. -G"CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles".  This will create a CodeBlocks project
   e.g. build\Win_MinGW\Debug\maidsafe-dht.cbp which will allow you to make and install all the targets from within
   the CodeBlocks IDE.

If MinGW was added to your path, you should also be able to build the targets from a Windows command terminal:

    *  Run mingw32-make to make all targets.
    *  Run mingw32-make Experimental to configure, build, test and upload to our dashboard.
    *  Run mingw32-make package to create an installer.
    *  Run mingw32-make install to install the maidsafe-dht library to c:\usr\lib and headers to c:\usr\include.
